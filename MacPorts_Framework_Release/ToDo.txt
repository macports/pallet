TO DO LIST (because there seems to be too much to get done haha)

Guide like documentation

Scrub Code

Ask Randall to look at perform exec methods

Implement IPC Notifications mechanism between the Helper Tool and Framework

Modify evaluateStringAsString to try evaluating, try evaluating with privileges
if there is an error, then return if there is still an error for the special
privileged methods: sync, selfupdate, exec methods etc.


Reimplement notifications so that, as Randall said, all threads should receive
all notifications that they have registered for

... in coming ... rant ...
I am thinking of another scheme instead of notifications ... I don't think
Objective-C has high order functions ... but something cool would be for
us to just call some user defined method when a $ui_priority 
call is made. So if say they wanted to update a progress bar during
-sync, we would just be calling whatever method they had to update the GUI.

I should read up some on Threading cause that might make things dicey ...

Also, we could throw in bindings support. How would this work? Don't know
yet ...

Fix bug in uninstall

objc_exception_throw - for break points to always be added to!
